Task 5 – Subqueries and Nested Queries
======================================

Objective:

- Use subqueries to filter or compute values within a main query.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Use a subquery in the WHERE clause:
   Example: Select employees whose salary is above the department’s average salary.

2. Use a subquery in the SELECT list:
   Example: Show each employee with the total number of departments.

3. Understand the difference between:
   - Correlated Subqueries: Depend on outer query row (executed per row).
