# Task: Aggregation with JOINs

## Objective
- Perform summary analysis on joined tables using aggregate functions.

## Requirements
- Use `COUNT()` and `SUM()` to calculate total orders and total sales per customer.
- Apply `GROUP BY` on the customer's first name.
- Use both `INNER JOIN` (only customers with orders) and `LEFT JOIN` (all customers) to compare outputs.
